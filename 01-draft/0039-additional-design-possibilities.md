# Zylisp: Potential Areas for Additional Design/Planning

Based on your comprehensive design document collection, here are areas that may need additional attention for a Lisp implementation built on Go.

## Missing or Under-Specified Areas

### 1. **Foreign Function Interface (FFI) / Go Interop Layer**

**Critical for Go Integration**

While you have AST generation covered, a clear FFI design is essential:

- **Calling Go functions from Zylisp**: Type marshaling, error handling conventions
- **Calling Zylisp from Go**: Embedding the runtime, passing callbacks
- **Go package imports**: How Zylisp code references and uses Go packages
- **Type bridging**: Converting between Zylisp and Go types (especially interfaces, channels, pointers)
- **Method invocation**: Calling methods on Go structs and interfaces
- **Struct field access**: Reading/writing Go struct fields from Zylisp

**Recommendation**: Create a design doc for "Zylisp-Go Interoperability Layer" covering reflection usage, type conversion strategies, and the syntax for Go interop.

### 2. **Module System & Package Management**

Not clearly addressed in your current docs:

- **Module loading**: How do Zylisp files import other Zylisp files?
- **Namespace management**: How do you prevent symbol collisions?
- **Dependency resolution**: Do you use Go modules? A separate package manager?
- **Compilation units**: What's the relationship between Zylisp modules and Go packages?
- **Code organization**: Directory structure conventions for Zylisp projects

**Recommendation**: Design a module system that leverages Go's module system where possible, with clear mapping between Zylisp namespaces and Go packages.

### 3. **Compilation Strategy & Performance**

Missing details on:

- **Compilation pipeline**: Zylisp → S-expr → Go AST → what next? Go source? Direct compilation?
- **Incremental compilation**: Can you recompile individual functions/modules?
- **Compilation caching**: How do you avoid recompiling unchanged code?
- **Performance characteristics**: What optimizations happen at compile time vs runtime?
- **Inline compilation vs ahead-of-time**: When does code get compiled?

**Recommendation**: Document the complete compilation pipeline and performance model.

### 4. **Concurrency Model**

**Critical Go Integration Point**

Go's goroutines and channels are fundamental. You need:

- **Goroutine creation**: Zylisp syntax for spawning concurrent processes
- **Channel operations**: First-class channel support in Zylisp
- **Select statements**: How to multiplex channel operations
- **Synchronization primitives**: Mutexes, wait groups, atomic operations
- **Integration with rely**: How supervision trees interact with goroutines
- **Memory model**: How Zylisp's immutability philosophy meshes with Go's shared memory

**Recommendation**: Create "Zylisp Concurrency Design" covering goroutine spawning, channel syntax, and CSP patterns.

### 5. **Type System Philosophy**

While you have AST generation, you haven't fully addressed:

- **Static vs dynamic typing**: Is Zylisp dynamically typed? Gradually typed?
- **Type inference**: How much type information is inferred vs explicit?
- **Go type integration**: How do Go's types appear in Zylisp?
- **Generic programming**: How do you handle Go generics in Zylisp?
- **Interface implementation**: How does Zylisp code implement Go interfaces?

**Recommendation**: Define Zylisp's type philosophy and how it maps to Go's type system.

### 6. **Standard Library Design**

What's in the box?

- **Core functions**: List manipulation, string handling, I/O
- **Data structures**: Sets, maps, vectors beyond basic Go types
- **Utilities**: File system, networking, JSON/XML parsing
- **Go standard library access**: Can you directly use `fmt`, `io`, `net/http`?
- **Zylisp-specific libraries**: Persistent data structures, functional utilities

**Recommendation**: Outline the standard library scope and organization.

### 7. **Garbage Collection & Memory Management**

**Go Integration Critical**

- **Memory ownership**: Who owns what between Zylisp and Go?
- **Reference cycles**: How do immutable persistent structures interact with Go's GC?
- **Memory pressure**: Large persistent structure handling
- **Finalization**: When do resources get cleaned up?
- **CGo implications**: If you ever need C interop through Go

**Recommendation**: Document memory management expectations and GC interaction patterns.

### 8. **Debugging & Tooling**

Partially covered but needs expansion:

- **Debugger integration**: Can you use Delve or other Go debuggers?
- **Stack traces**: How do Zylisp stack frames appear in errors?
- **Profiling**: CPU and memory profiling of Zylisp code
- **IDE support**: LSP server for editor integration
- **Testing framework**: Unit testing conventions for Zylisp
- **Benchmarking**: Performance testing tools

**Recommendation**: Create a comprehensive tooling design document.

### 9. **Reflection & Metaprogramming**

You have macros covered, but:

- **Runtime reflection**: Can Zylisp code inspect types at runtime?
- **Code generation**: Beyond macros, dynamic code creation
- **Eval**: Is there a runtime `eval` function?
- **Code as data**: How much metaprogramming is possible at runtime?
- **Go reflection usage**: When and how to use Go's reflection package

**Recommendation**: Design runtime metaprogramming capabilities.

### 10. **Numeric Tower**

Not addressed:

- **Number types**: Integers, floats, rationals, complex numbers
- **Arbitrary precision**: Big integers, big floats
- **Numeric coercion**: Automatic promotion rules
- **Go numeric types**: How do Go's `int`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64` map?

**Recommendation**: Define the numeric type system.

### 11. **String & Text Handling**

- **String representation**: Go strings, runes, bytes
- **Unicode support**: Text processing philosophy
- **Regular expressions**: Integration with Go's `regexp` package
- **String interpolation**: Syntax and implementation

### 12. **Error Propagation Philosophy**

You have error handling design, but:

- **Go error values**: How do Go errors work in Zylisp?
- **Panic/recover**: Should Zylisp use Go's panic? Conditions?
- **Error wrapping**: Integration with Go 1.13+ error wrapping
- **Result types**: Functional error handling patterns

## Go-Specific Integration Concerns

### **A. Context Propagation**

Go's `context.Context` is pervasive for cancellation and timeouts. How does this work in Zylisp?

### **B. Defer, Panic, Recover**

Go's unique resource management. Should Zylisp expose these? Transform them?

### **C. Pointer Semantics**

Go distinguishes value and pointer receivers. How does Zylisp handle this?

### **D. Zero Values**

Go's zero value semantics. How do these interact with Zylisp's semantics?

### **E. Build Tags & Conditional Compilation**

How do you handle platform-specific code?

### **F. CGo Compatibility**

If Go code you interop with uses CGo, how does this impact Zylisp?

### **G. Race Detector**

Can you use Go's race detector with Zylisp code?

### **H. Escape Analysis**

Does Zylisp code interfere with Go's escape analysis and stack allocation?

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **FFI/Go Interop Layer** - Essential for practical use
2. **Concurrency Model** - Core to Go's value proposition
3. **Module System** - Needed for code organization
4. **Compilation Strategy** - Determines development workflow

### Medium Priority

5. **Type System Philosophy** - Affects everything else
6. **Standard Library Design** - Developer experience
7. **Debugging & Tooling** - Essential for adoption

### Lower Priority (but still important)

8. **Numeric Tower** - Can start simple, expand later
9. **String Handling** - Leverage Go's, add convenience
10. **Reflection & Runtime Metaprogramming** - Nice to have

## Closing Thoughts

Your existing design documentation is thorough on the Lisp-to-Go-AST pipeline, but the bidirectional integration layer (calling Go from Zylisp and embedding Zylisp in Go) needs equal attention. The concurrency model is particularly critical since it's Go's killer feature and differentiates it from most Lisp implementations.

Consider that Zylisp's success depends on making Go's strengths accessible while providing Lisp's metaprogramming power. The seam between these two worlds is where the most careful design work is needed.
